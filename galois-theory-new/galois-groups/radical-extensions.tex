    A {\emphcolor simple radical extension} is a field extension $K/F$ such that $K=F[\alpha]$ and $\alpha^n=a\in F$ for $n=[K:F]$.
    In such a case, we write $K=F[\root n\of a]$.

\edefn

In such a case, $x^n-a$ is the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ since it has degree $n=[K:F]$.

\bprop

    Suppose $F$ has a primitive root of unity $\rho$ of degree $n$.
    Then any simple radical extension of degree $n$ is cyclic.

\eprop

\Proof suppose $K=F[\alpha]$ for $\alpha^n=a\in F$ and $[K:F]=1$.
Then
$$ x^n - a = \prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(x-\alpha\rho^i) $$
So the splitting field of $x^n-a$ is
$$ F[\alpha,\alpha\rho,\dots,\alpha\rho^{n-1}] = F[\alpha,\rho] = F[\alpha] = K $$
since $\rho$ is already in $F$.
This means that $K$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial, so $K/F$ is Galois.

Now, an $F$-automorphism must map $\alpha$ to $\rho^i\alpha$.
There are $n$ choices for $i$ and $n=[K:F]=\abs{\Galof{K/F}}$, so every choice of $i$ gives an automorphism.
In particular $\sigma(\alpha)=\rho\alpha$ is an $F$-automorphism.
And inductively $\sigma^i(\alpha)=\rho^i\alpha$, so the degree of $\sigma$ is at least $n$.
But the order of the Galois group is $n$, so $o(\sigma)=\abs{\Galof{K/F}}$ and thus $\Galof{K/F}$ is generated by $\sigma$ as required.

\bthrm[title=Kummer's Theorem, name=kummer]

    Suppose $F$ has a primitive root of unity $\rho$ of degree $n$
    Then every cyclic field extension of dimension $n$ is simple radical.

\ethrm

\Proof suppose $K/F$ is cyclic of dimension $n$.
We know that for $a\in F$, $N(a)=a^n$, and in particular $N(\rho)=1$.
Thus by \refmath{hilbert90}, $\rho=\frac\alpha{\sigma(\alpha)}$ for some $\alpha\in K$.
Then
$$ 1 = \rho^n = \frac{\alpha^n}{\sigma(\alpha)^n} \implies \sigma(\alpha^n) = \alpha^n $$
so $\alpha^n$ is a fixed point of $\sigma$.
Since $\sigma$ generates $\Galof{K/F}$, it is a fixed point of $\Galof{K/F}$, i.e. $a=\alpha^n\in F$.

We know that $\sigma^i(\alpha)=\rho^i\alpha$ so $\alpha\notin K^{\gen{\sigma^i}}$ for any $i\divides n$.
And so $K=F[\alpha]$, $\alpha^n=a\in F$, and $[K:F]=n$.
Meaning $K/F$ is simple radical.
\qed

\bdefn

    A {\emphcolor radical series} over $F$ is a sequence of fields $F=F_0\subseteq F_1\subseteq\cdots\subseteq F_n$, such that $F_{i+1}/F_i$ is a simple radical extension for each $i$.
    Each $F_i/F$ is a {\emphcolor radical extension}.

\bdefn

    A polynomial $f\in F[x]$ is {\emphcolor solvable by radicals} if there exists a radical extension $K/F$ such that $f$ has a root in $K$.
