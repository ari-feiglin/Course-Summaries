    Suppose $F$ and $K$ are fields such that $F\subseteq K$.
    Then the pair is called a {\emphcolor field extension} and is denoted $K/F$.

\edefn

Notice that if $K/F$ is a field extension, then $K$ can be viewed as a $F$-linear space, and thus has a dimension.
We denote this dimension $[K:F]\coloneqq\dim_FK$, this is unsurprisingly called the {\it dimension} (or {\it degree} of the extension.
An extension is called {\it finite} if its dimension is finite.
Immediately we can prove a useful theorem about dimensions of extensions:

\bthrm

    Suppose $K/F$ is a field extension and $V$ a $K$-vector space.
    Then by viewing $V$ as an $F$-linear space:
    $$ \dim_FV = \dim_KV\cdot[K:F] $$

\ethrm

\Proof let $B_1$ be a basis for $V$ relative to $K$ and $B_2$ be a basis for $K$ relative to $F$.
Then define $B=\set{\alpha v}[\alpha\in B_2,v\in B_1]\subseteq V$, which we claim is a basis for $V$ relative to $F$.
Firstly, it is linearly independent: suppose $\alpha_1v_1,\dots,\alpha_nv_n$ are in $B$ and $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n$ are in $F$ such that
$$ \beta_1\alpha_1v_1 + \cdots + \beta_n\alpha_nv_n = 0 $$
Since $B_1$ is a basis for $V$, then $\beta_i\alpha_i=0$ for all $i$, and since $B_2$ is a basis it has no zeroes, so $\beta_i=0$ for all $i$, meaning $B$ is linearly independent.

$B$ spans $V$ since if $v\in B$ then $v=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_iv_i$ for $v_i\in B_1$ and $\alpha_i\in K$, and so each $\alpha_i$ can be written as the linear combination of elements in $B_2$.
So all in all $v$ can be written as the linear combination of elements in $B$.
And so $B$ is a basis of $V$, and $(\alpha,v)\mapsto\alpha v$ is a bijection from $B_1\times B_2$ to $B$: it obviously is surjective and if $\alpha_1v_1=\alpha_2v_2$ then $\alpha_1=\alpha_2$ and $v_1=v_2$
since $B_1$ is linearly independent.
Thus $V$ is a basis of cardinality $\abs{B_1\times B_2}=\dim_KV\cdot[K:F]$ as required.
\qed

In particular if $E/K/F$ are field extensions then
$$ [E:F] = [E:K]\cdot[K:F] $$
this is called the {\it multiplicity of dimension}.
