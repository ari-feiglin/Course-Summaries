In this subsection we will define another form of sequent calculus.

\bdefn

    A define $\Lambda\subseteq{\cal F}$ to be a set of axioms, called the {\emphcolor logical axiom scheme}.
    Now, let $\Gamma$ be a set of {\emphcolor rules of inference}, predicates of the form $R\in\Lambda^n\times\Lambda$ for $n>0$, where $R((\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n),\phi)$ which is to be understood as
    ``{\it if $\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n$ then $\phi$}''.

    If $X\subseteq{\cal F}$ is a set of formulas, then a {\emphcolor proof}\addtoindex{proof} is a sequence $\Phi=(\phi_0,\dots,\phi_n)$ where for every $i$, $\phi_i$ is either in $X\cup\Gamma$ or there
    exists a rule of inference $R\in\Gamma$ and indexes $i_1,\dots,i_n<i$ such that $R((\phi_{i_1},\dots,\phi_{i_n}),\phi)$.
    In such a case, $\phi_n$ is termed {\emphcolor derivable} (or {\emphcolor provable}) from $X$, and is written $X\vsim\phi_n$ ($\vsim$ to differentiate it from the derivability relation $\vdash$ from
    the previous subsection).

\edefn

Hilbert-style calculi will use the following axiom scheme $\Lambda$:

\medskip
\tabskip=0pt plus 1fil
\halign to \hsize{$#$\hfil\tabskip=2cm&$#$\hfil\tabskip=0pt plus 1fil\cr
    \Lambda1\quad (\alpha\to\beta\to\gamma)\to(\alpha\to\beta)\to\alpha\to\beta & \Lambda2\quad \alpha\to\beta\to\alpha\land\beta\cr
    \Lambda3\quad \alpha\land\beta\to\alpha,\quad\alpha\land\beta\to\beta & \Lambda3\quad (\alpha\to\neg\beta)\to\beta\to\neg\alpha\cr
}

And there is only a single rule of inference: $R((\alpha,\alpha\to\beta),\beta)$ called {\it modus ponens}, abbreviated MP.
Essentially if $\alpha$ and $\alpha\to\beta$ then $\beta$.

The finiteness theorem for $\vsim$ is immediate, since $X\vsim\alpha$ requires a {\it finite} proof from $X$.
And notice that
$$ X\vsim\alpha,\alpha\to\beta \implies X\vsim\beta $$
Since if $\Phi_1=(\phi_0,\dots,\phi_n)$ is a proof of $\alpha$, and $\Phi_2=(\phi'_0,\dots,\phi'_m)$ is a proof of $\alpha\to\beta$, then
$$ \Phi=(\phi_0,\dots,\phi_n,\phi'_0,\dots,\phi'_m,\beta) $$
is a proof of $\alpha\to\beta$.
