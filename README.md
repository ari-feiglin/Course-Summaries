This is a collection of summaries/notes I wrote for various courses I took in university.
The material should for the most part follow what is taught at Bar Ilan University.
These lecture notes and summaries were not transcribed verbatim, there are places where I added my own notes/additions for the sake of (my and/or others') understanding.

Included in the repository are also some of my solutions to coursework.
Not all solutions are verified, so use them (as help, do not copy them directly) at your own risk.
I am not liable for lost points.

The TeX source is not publicly available, but may be granted on a person-by-person basis.
If you're interested in the source, send me an email.

Good luck with your studies!
Any questions can be forwarded to my email: `ari.feiglin@gmail.com`.
