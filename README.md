This is a collection of summaries/notes I wrote for various courses I took in university.
The material should for the most part follow what is taught at Bar Ilan University.
These lecture notes and summaries were not transcribed verbatim, there are places where I added my own notes/additions for the sake of (my and/or others') understanding.
