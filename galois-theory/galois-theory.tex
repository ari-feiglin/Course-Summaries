\section{Field Extensions}

Suppose $F\subseteq K$ are fields, then $K$ is certainly also an $F$-vector space and therefore has a dimension and we denote it $[K:F]\coloneqq\dim_FK$.

\bthrm

    Suppose $F\subseteq K$ and $V$ is a $K$-vector space, then $V$ is also a vector space over $F$ as well, and $\dim_FV=[K:F]\dim_KV$.

\ethrm

\Proof Let $B_1\subseteq V$ be a basis for $V$ over $K$ and $B_2\subseteq K$ be a basis for $K$ over $F$, then define $B=\set{\alpha v}[\alpha\in B_2,v\in B_1]$.
This is a basis for $V$ in $F$, it is linearly independent since if $\alpha_1v_1,\dots,\alpha_nv_n\in B$ and $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n\in F$ then $\sum_{i=1}^n\beta_i\alpha_iv_i=0$ implies $\beta_i\alpha_i=0$
for all $i$ since $B_1$ is a basis, and this means that $\beta_i$ or $\alpha_i$ is zero, but $\alpha_iv_i\in B$ so $\beta_i=0$ as required.
$B$ spans $V$ since for $v\in B$ there exist $v_1,\dots,v_n\in B_1$ and $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\in K$ such that $v=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_iv_i$ and $\alpha_i$ can be written as the linear combination of
elements in $B_2$ by elements of $F$ which gives a linear combination of elements in $B$ of $F$.
So $B$ is indeed a basis for $V$ over $F$.
Finally $B\cong B_2\times B_1$ since $(\alpha,v)\mapsto\alpha v$ is a bijection: it is obviously surjective and $\alpha_1v_1=\alpha_2v_2$ implies $\alpha_1=\alpha_2,v_1=v_2$ since $v_1,v_2$ are independent.
Thus we have
$$ \dim_FV = \abs B = \abs{B_2\times B_1} = [K:F]\dim_K V $$
\qed

In particular if $F\subseteq K\subseteq E$ are fields then $[E:F]=[E:K]\cdot[K:F]$.

The following are methods of constructing fields:
\benum
    \item If $R$ is a commutative ring and $M\triangleleft R$ is a maximal ideal then $\slfrac RM$ is a field.
        Specifically if $R=F[x]$ and $p$ is an irreducible polynomial, $\gen p$ is maximal and $\slfrac{F[x]}{\gen p}$ is a field.
    \item If $F$ is a field, then the set of rational functions is also a field:
        $$ F \subseteq F(x) \coloneqq \set{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}[f,g\in F[x],\,g(x)\neq0] $$
        In general if $R$ is an integral domain then its field of fractions/quotients $q(R)\coloneqq\set{\frac ab}[a,b\in R,\,b\neq0]$ is a field.
        And $F(x)$ is the quotient field of $F[x]$.
    \item If $F_0\subseteq F_1\subseteq F_2\subseteq\cdots$ is a chain of fields then so is $\bigcup F_n$ (the theory of fields is inductive, this holds for arbitrary chains, not just inductive ones).
        So for example $F(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots)$ is a field since we can define $F_n=F(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$ (the quotient field of $F[\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n]$) and the union of this chain
        is $F(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots)$.
\eenum

Let $F$ be a field and $F\subseteq K$ a ring with $a\in K$, we define a homomorphism $F[\lambda]\xvarrightarrow{\,\psi_a\,}K$ defined by $\alpha\mapsto\alpha$ for $\alpha\in F$
and $\lambda\mapsto a$, meaning
$$ \psi_a\parens{\sum\alpha_i\lambda^i} = \sum\alpha_i a^i \qquad (\psi_a(f)=f(a)) $$
In particular $\psi_a$ is a linear transformation from $F$ to $K$, and is called the {\it evaluation homomorphism} at $a$.
The kernel of the homomorphism is
$$ \ker\psi_a = \set{f\in F[\lambda]}[f(a)=0] \triangleleft F[\lambda] $$

\bdefn

    $a\in K$ is {\emphcolor algebraic} if $\ker\psi_a\neq0$ and {\emphcolor transcendental} if the kernel is trivial.

\edefn

If $a$ is transcendental then $\ker\psi_a$ and so $\Im\psi_a=\set{f(a)}[{f\in F[\lambda]}]=F[a]\cong F[\lambda]$.
In fact we get
$$ \vcenter{\ialign{&${}\m@th#{}$\cr
    F &\subseteq& F[a] &\subseteq& F(a) &\subseteq& K\cr 
      &         & \cong &        & \cong\cr
      &         & F[x]  &        & F(x)\cr
    }}
$$

Now if $a$ is algebraic, since $F[x]$ is a euclidean domain and therefore a PID, the kernel has a generator $\ker\psi_a=\gen h=h\cdot F[\lambda]$.
So $h(a)=0$ and $f(a)=0\implies h\divides f$, and $h$ is called the {\it minimal polynomial} of $a$.
And so
$$ \slfrac{F[\lambda]}{\gen h} = \slfrac{F[\lambda]}{\ker\psi_a} \cong \Im\psi_a = \set{f(a)}[{f\in F[\lambda]}] = F[a] = \lspanof{1,a,\dots,a^{n-1}} \subseteq K $$
where $n=\deg h$, since $f(x)=q(x)h(x)+r(x)$ where $\deg r<\deg h=n$ and so $f(a)=r(a)$.
$\set{1,\dots,a^{n-1}}$ is a basis due to $h$ being minimal, a zeroing linear combination would give a zeroing polynomial of $a$ of degree less than $h$.
This means that the dimension of $F[a]$ as an $F$-vector space is $n$, ie. $\bigl[F[a]:F\bigr]=n$.

Since $K$ is an integral domain and therefore so too is $F[a]$ and this means that $\gen h$ is a prime ideal (since $\slfrac RI$ is an integral domain if and only if $I$ is prime), this means
that $h$ is a prime (irreducible) polynomial.
And since $F[a]$ is a PID, prime and maximal ideals are one and the same, so $\gen h$ is maximal and therefore $\slfrac{F[\lambda]}{\gen h}\cong F[a]$ is a field.
Let us summarize this:

\bprop

    Let $F\subseteq K$ where $K$ is an integral domain and $a\in K$ is algebraic in $F$, let $h_a$ be its minimal polynomial.
    Then $(1)$ $h_a$ is irreducible, $(2)$ $F[a]$ is a field, $(3)$ $\bigl[F[a]:F\bigr]=\deg h_a$.

\eprop

So for example let $a\in K\setminus F$ be algebraic then $F\subseteq F[a]\subseteq K$ and suppose $[K:F]=p$ is prime.
Then $p=[K:F]=[K:F[a]]\cdot[F[a]:F]$, and since $a\in F[a]\setminus F$ this means $[F[a]:F]>1$ so $[F[a]:F]=p$ and $[K:F[a]]=1$ since $p$ is prime so $F[a]=K$.

\bcoro

    Suppose $F$ is a field and $F\subseteq K$ is an integral domain with finite dimension.
    Then every element of $K$ is algebraic and $K$ is a field.

\ecoro

\Proof Let $a\in K$ then $[K:F]=[K:F[a]]\cdot[F[a]:F]$ so $[F[a]:F]$ is finite.
If $a$ were transcendental then $F[a]\cong F[x]$ and $F[x]$ has infinite dimension over $F$.
$K$ is a field since every $a\in K$ must have a multiplicative inverse, since $F[a]$ is a field.
\qed

Notice that $[F[a,b]:F[a]]\leq [F[b]:F]$ since if $h_b$ is $b$'s minimal polynomial in $F$ then it is also a zeroing polynomial in $F[a]$.
This means that
$$ [F[a,b]:F] = [F[a,b]:F[a]]\cdot[F[a]:F] \leq [F[b]:F]\cdot[F[a]:F] $$

\bcoro

    Let $F$ be a field and $K$ a field extension, define
    $$ {\rm Alg}_F(K) \coloneqq \set{a\in K}[\hbox{$a$ is algebraic over $F$}] . $$
    This is a field.
    Furthermore $F\subseteq{\rm Alg}_F(K)$ is an algebraic extension (all elements of ${\rm Alg}_F(K)$ are algebraic in $F$), and ${\rm Alg}_F(K)\subseteq K$ is a purely transcendental extension (all
    elements in $K\setminus{\rm Alg}_F(K)$ are transcendental in ${\rm Alg}_F(K)$).

\ecoro

\Proof Notice that $F[a\cdot b],F[a+b]\subseteq F[a,b]$ and so $[F[a,b]:F]\leq[F[b]:F]\cdot[F[a]:F]<\infty$, so ${\rm Alg}_F(K)$ is closed under addition and multiplication (and obviously additive inverses).
For $a$ algebraic, $F[a]$ is a field so $a^{-1}\in F[a]$ and so $F[a^{-1}]\subseteq F[a]$ and therefore $[F[a^{-1}]:F]<\infty$ so $a^{-1}$ is algebraic as well (and so by symmetry $F[a]=F[a^{-1}]$).
So ${\rm Alg}_F(K)$ is indeed a field.

To show that ${\rm Alg}_F(K)\subseteq K$ is a pure transcendental extension, notice that if $F_1\subseteq F_2\subseteq F_3$ where $F_1\subseteq F_2$ is algebraic, if $a\in F_3$ is algebraic in $F_2$
it is also algebraic in $F_1$.
Indeed if $f\in F_2[x]$ such that $f(a)=0$, let its coefficients be $b_i$ then $a$ is algebraic in $F_1[b_0,\dots,b_n]$ and so
$$ [F_1[b_0,\dots,b_n,a]:F_1[b_0,\dots,b_n]] = [F_1[b_0,\dots,b_n,a]:F_1[b_0,\dots,b_n]]\cdot[F_1[b_0,\dots,b_n]:F_1] $$
and this is finite since $b_0,\dots,b_n$ are algebraic in $F_1$ as they are in $F_2$, so both terms are finite.
So if $K$ had any algebraic numbers not in ${\rm Alg}_F(K)$, they would be algebraic in $F$ and thus in ${\rm Alg}_F(K)$ in contradiction.
\qed
