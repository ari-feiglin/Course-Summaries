    Let $f,f_n$ be nonnegative measurable functions on $X$ such that $f_n\to f$ and $f_n\leq f$.
    Prove that
    $$ \lim\int f_n = \int f $$

\eexerc

Define $g_n=\maxof{f_1,\dots,f_n}$, then for every $n$, $f_n\leq g_n\leq f$ so $g_n$ is monotonically increasing to $f$, meaning $\lim\int f_n\leq\lim\int g_n=\int f$.
By Fatou,
$$ \int f = \int\liminf f_n \leq \liminf\int f_n = \lim\int f_n $$
So we have both directions of the inequality, meaning $\lim\int f_n=\int f$ as required.

    Let $f$ be a measurable nonnegative function, then define $F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xf\,dx$.
    Show that $F$ is continuous.

\eexerc

Let $a\in{\bb R}$ and take $x_n\nearrow a$, then $F(x_n)=\int_{-\infty}^{x_n}f\,d\mu=\int_{\bb R}f\chi_{(-\infty,x_n)}$.
Since $f\cdot\chi_{(-\infty,x_n)}$ is increasing to $f\cdot\chi_{(-\infty,a)}$ we get that $F(x_n)\longto\int_{-\infty}^af=F(a)$ by the monotone convergence theorem.
Note that the monotone convergence theorem works for $f_n$ decreasing if $f_1$ is integrable: define $g_n=f_1-f_n$ which is nonnegative and increasing and $g_n\nearrow f_1-f$ so
$$ \lim\int g_n = \int f_1-f \implies \lim\int f_1-f_n = \int f_1-\int f \implies \lim\int f_n = \int f $$
So for $x_n\searrow a$, $f\cdot\chi_{(-\infty,x_n)}$ is decreasing to $f\cdot\chi_{(-\infty,a)}$, and since these are all bound by $f$ which is integrable they are integrable, so the monotone convergence
theore gives us again that $F(x_n)\longto\int_{-\infty}^af=F(a)$ again.

\bexerc

    Let $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space such that $\mu(X)=1$.
    Then suppose $A,B,C\in\Sigma$ are measurable such that $\mu(A)+\mu(B)+\mu(C)\geq2.5$.
    Is it possible for $A\cap B\cap C=\varnothing$?

\eexerc

Suppose so, then $A^c\cup B^c\cup C^c=X$ so $\mu(A^c\cup B^c\cup C^c)=1$, but by subadditivity
$$ \mu(A^c\cup B^c\cup C^c) \leq \mu(A^c) + \mu(B^c) + \mu(C^c) = 3 - \mu(A) - \mu(B) - \mu(C) \leq 3 - 2.5 = 0.5 $$
So we have that $1\leq0.5$ in contradiction.

\bye
